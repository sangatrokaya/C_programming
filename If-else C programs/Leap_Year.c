// C program to check whether a given year is Leap year or not
/*
Leap year  occurs every 4 years but there are some exceptions:
1. If the year is divisible by 100, then it is not a leap year, unlessâ€¦
2. The year is also divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
For example, the year 2000 was a leap year because it is divisible by both 100 and 400.
