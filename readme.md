# 1. Introduction to C programming:

    - procedure oriented programming language.
    - feature rich powerful general purpose programming language.
    - programs written in C are highly protable.
    - gives programmer utmost control and efficiency.

## Why C program ?

    - robust language, rich set of built-in functions, data types and operators.
    - programs written in C are efficient.
    - has capabillities of both assmebly language (low level features) and high level language. Thus suits for writing both system software and application software.
    - highly protable language.
    - supports low level features like bit level programming and direct access to memory using pointer.
    - has high level constructs and more user friendly as its syntaxes approaches to English like language.

## Applications of C lanuage:

    1. Operating systems:
        - you can write your own OS using C.
        - Popular OS like Microsoft's Windows kernel, Linux kernel and Apple's OS X kernel  were all mostly written in C.
    
    2. Language Compilers:
        - compilers are programs to translate high level language to machine language.
        - most of the modern compilers are made in C.
        - Even part of C compiler is written in C.
        - Fun saying: **C language is written in C language and C compiler is used to compile C language :grinning:**
