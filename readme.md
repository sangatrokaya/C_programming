# 1. Introduction to C programming language:

    - procedure oriented programming language.
    - feature rich powerful general purpose programming language.
    - programs written in C are highly protable.
    - gives programmer utmost control and efficiency.

## Why C program ?

    - robust language, rich set of built-in functions, data types and operators.
    - programs written in C are efficient.
    - has capabillities of both assmebly language (low level features) and high level language. Thus suits for writing both system software and application software.
    - highly protable language.
    - supports low level features like bit level programming and direct access to memory using pointer.
    - has high level constructs and more user friendly as its syntaxes approaches to English like language.

## Applications of C lanuage:

    1. Operating systems:
        - you can write your own OS using C.
        - Popular OS like Microsoft's Windows kernel, Linux kernel and Apple's OS X kernel  were all mostly written in C.
    
    2. Language Compilers:
        - compilers are programs to translate high level language to machine language.
        - most of the modern compilers are made in C.
        - Even part of C compiler is written in C.
        - Fun saying: **C language is written in C language and C compiler is used to compile C language.
    
    3. Language Interpreters:
        - are also program to translate high level language to machine language.
        - C can be used to build interpreters as well.
        - Interpreters lke Python Interpreter, MATLAB Interpreter etc. are written in C.

    4. Assemblers:
        - program used to translate assembly language to machine language.
        - GNU assembler is written in C.

    5. Text Editors:
        - text editors like Vim, gedit are written in C.
    
    6. Drivers:
        - C is used to write different driver software like Network driver, Keyboard driver, Mouse driver etc.
    
    7. Database Programs:
        - most popular db softwares like Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL etc are written in C.
    
    8. Embedded systems:
        - ES like coffee maker, microwave, climate control systems etc are mostly programmed in C.

## Features of C Programming:

    1. well suited for structured modular programming.
    2. Programs written in C are efficient and executes much faster.
    3. powerful and feature rich language with rich set of built-in functions, data types and operators.
    4. highly protable i.e. code written in one machine can be moved to other.
    5. supports low level features as well as some high level features.
    6. has only 32 keywords and several standard built-in functions.
    7. has high level constructs and more user friendly.
